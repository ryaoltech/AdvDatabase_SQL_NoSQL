/*
An administration page in the DoGood Donor application allows employees to enter multiple combinations of donor type and pledge amount to determine data to retrieve. 
Create a block with a single cursor that allows retrieving data and handling multiple combinations of donor type and pledge amount as input.

The donor name and pledge amount should be retrieved and displayed for each pledge that matches the donor type and is greater than the pledge amount indicated. 
Use a collection to provide the input data. Test the block using the following input data. 
Keep in mind that these inputs should be processed with one execution of the block. 
The donor type code I represents Individual, and B represents Business. 
Both has to be executed in one run of code.
Donor Type --- Pledge Amount
I 250
B 500
